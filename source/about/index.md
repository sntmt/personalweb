## Hello
Learning is one of the most important parts of my life, both because of the effort to understand and learn new technologies and methodologies, and because of the time I spend trying them every day.

My experience as a professional is a mixture of art and design, computer graphics generation and programming at the same time; In software development, think analytically, optimally and logically. In the design part, in a creative, abstract way, thinking not in code, but in colors, shapes, movement, to produce a reaction to the viewer.

I cannot say that I have any preference within software development or artistic creation in the digital field, everything seems to interest me and it never ceases to amaze me. The mixture of both through creative and procedurally generated programming is perhaps the one that provokes the most interest.

## Before
Although I always had the concern and desire to learn more about software development, dedicating a little time to learning programming tools and languages, it was not until 2017 that my professional career as a developer began.

Until then, I worked as a broadcast designer, generalist / 3D animator, and visual effects composer. I did it working in television and production / visual effects companies, as well as freelance, making audiovisual products that include the idea, creativity, creation of the pieces, editing and direction.

It is when the creation of scripts for the development of plugins for the applications with I worked such as MEL[^1]  (Maya Embedded Language), VEX[^2] in Sidefx Houdini, and later with Python, caught my attention.

### Now
Finally, in the need to learn more about software development, I end up dedicating myself to programming, working first in the part that I knew best designing and creating interfaces, and development of dynamic applications in the frontend and later in the backend.

### Next
Iot and as well as new forms of interaction with the user, either through touch interfaces or tangible[^3] objects.

Real-time graphics generation. The experience in generating 3D scenes naturally led me to want to know the process of creating graphics through Opengl, and in particular GLSL[^4]. Libraries such as Processing, Openrndr or Openframeworks.

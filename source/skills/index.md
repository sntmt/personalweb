## The mean of "Fullstack"
Contained in the word **Fullstack** we find dozens of technologies, frameworks, programming languages, architectures, functionalities, methodologies ... sometimes very different from one another.

As a developer, it is my obligation to create code that is optimized, testable, documented, secure, easy to maintain and resistant to errors.

From my point of view, you have to focus on a stack that allows me to offer work efficiently, advance my knowledge in certain areas and not be "the guy who does everything", but superficially.

Can you be an expert in a Java or Python server-side framework, and at the same time know all the ins and outs of creating a dynamic app on the client side? I do not think so.

To be honest, "expert" is not knowing, it is **mastering** an area. SPA, SSE, Kubernetes, Oauth, GRPC are randomly chosen words that take a long time to learn and master. Wanting to pretend to master all of them and offering as an expert would be for me, at least pretentious.
